Some steps and future potential ideas for the app

app idea: image library app using Flask and sqlalchemy

Begin adding some basic functionality:
- button that allows users to switch between pages
- have a button that allows you to upload pictures
	- these pictures get added to the database along with a unique 	  identifier, the picture itself, and the date uploaded
- display the pictures that have been saved in like a moving, or a rolling format (where they fade in to screen for a few seconds and then fade out)
- have a button that allows you to delete a picture if you donâ€™t want it on there

Some nice add ons for the future that can be implemented once a simple app is working:
- add user registration at some point in the future
- see what personal files you have uploaded on some html page. Then on another page you can see what others have posted as well! (Essentially this is like instagram almost, except there are no captions on the pictures)
- add functionality that allows the user to display some text along with the picture itself. This shows up when the picture displays as well
- look at ways that pictures can be stored in folders. Then the user can select what folder that they want to display on the rotating timer
